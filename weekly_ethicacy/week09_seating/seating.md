1.	The algorithm would check to see the number of tickets purchased at one time by a couple or family. 
2.	Check the Last name of passengers 
3.	Check the age of the passengers. 
4.	Check the time the tickets were purchased. 
5.	What would also be crucial to take into consideration is if multiple tickets purchased at one time and tickets which passengers have the same family name would have the priority in having their seating close to one another - a married couple or person in a relationship wouldnâ€™t want to be distanced from each other on the same flight. 
6.	Regarding families, you do not want children sitting separately from their parents by seating. This would have the highest priority because children would need supervision. This being the case the algorithm should check for the purchase time of tickets, the last name, and ages of the passengers for the flight.
7.	Checking the time frame in which tickets were purchased would influence the decision of where passengers are seated. You would assume that a family would not book a last minute flight. It may be individuals who for business purposes or last-minute events would book last minute seats. If it is a priority for them to be in a certain section or near each other, paying extra, though not fair, should be understandable.
